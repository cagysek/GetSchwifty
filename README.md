# Get schwifty!

iOS application that communicates with the [Rick And Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) API. 

## Architecture and technology
- MVVM-C (inspired by [this](https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/coordinator-pattern-in-swiftui/) , I wanted to try this approach)
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- Apollo (used GraphQL for data retrieval)


## Done
- Most of the layout
- App navigation
- Dark/light mode
- Character list
- Searching
- Character detail

## Missing
- Favorite list
- Data layer for storing favourite characters (I would like to use sqlite)
- Marking favourites
- Some UX improvements
